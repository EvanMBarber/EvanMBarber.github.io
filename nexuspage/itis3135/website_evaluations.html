    <h3>Bass Pro Shops</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.basspro.com/home" target="_blank">Bass Pro Shops</a></p>
    <div class="container">
    <div class = 'bullet-points'>
    <p>
      Bass Pro Shops demonstrates strong web design principles with clear navigation, 
      consistent branding, and a visually appealing layout that supports the userâ€™s shopping journey.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Text is legible with high contrast against background.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts, colors, and layout across pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is neatly structured with logical visual flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items menus, categories and products are grouped together.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </div>




    <h3>Arngren.net</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></p>
    <div class="container">
    <div class = 'bullet-points'>
    <p>
      Arngren.net is a great example of poor web design. The site overwhelms users with clutter, 
      inconsistent formatting, and a lack of clear navigation, making it difficult to find information. It almost resembles a teenagers room.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Poor text/background choices reduce readability. Colors consist of mainly defualts with maximum saturation.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent styles make the page look chaotic. There are multiple font sizes in places where they don't need to be.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are scattered with little visual organization. There is almost no alignment at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated content is crammed together and even overlapping.</li>
    </ul>
