          who are helping shape the universe of Star Grazer. From concept art to
          community ship designs, every pixel brings us one step closer to launch.

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Star Grazer was created by NebulaForge Studios,
          a small team of indie developers and digital artists who share a passion
          for retro-style games and pixel art. Our mission is to bring creativity
          and community together by providing a space where players and artists
          can design, showcase, and submit custom pixel ships for use in upcoming
          space shooter projects.

          What started as a simple idea between friends has grown into a
          collaborative hub for artists around the world who love turning tiny
          pixels into massive imagination.</p>

        <h3>Our team of talented developers</h3>

          <figcaption>Markus</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Markus is the lead programmer at NebulaForge Studios, where he
          brings the technical heart of Star Grazer to life. With a strong
          background in gameplay systems and optimization, Markus specializes in turning
          creative ideas into smooth, responsive code. He’s passionate about blending old-school
          game mechanics with modern design practices, drawing inspiration from the 16-bit
          arcade titles he grew up playing. When he’s not coding late into the night, Markus
          enjoys experimenting with new game engines and sharing development tips with the
          indie dev community.

          <figcaption>Jeff</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Jeff is the sound designer for NebulaForge Studios and the creative
          force behind every blast, hum, and melody in Star Grazer. With years
          of experience in digital audio production, he crafts immersive soundscapes that bring
          each pixelated battle and cosmic journey to life. Inspired by the chiptune tracks and
          synth-heavy arcade music of the early ’90s, Jeff combines retro tones with modern
          mixing techniques to give Star Grazer its signature sound. When he’s not composing,
          he’s usually tinkering with vintage keyboards or sampling everyday noises for his next
          in-game sound effect.

          <figcaption>Emily</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Emily is the lead artist at NebulaForge Studios and the visionary
          behind the distinct look of Star Grazer. Her love for pixel art began
          with sketching spaceships and characters on graph paper as a kid, which evolved into a
          full-time passion for digital art and game design. Emily’s attention to color, motion,
          and atmosphere gives Star Grazer its nostalgic yet vibrant identity. She draws
          inspiration from classic arcade shooters and early console games, blending that retro
          energy with modern flair. When she’s not designing new assets, Emily can be found
          illustrating concept art or mentoring up-and-coming pixel artists in the community.

        <h2>What are we making?</h2>
        <p>
          Star Grazer is a 2D open-world, top-down shooter built in
          GameMaker Studio 2. Players pilot customizable ships through
          sprawling galaxies, battling enemies, completing missions, and uncovering
          secrets hidden across the stars. Our goal is to capture the thrill and
          challenge of classic arcade shooters while blending them with modern open-world
          exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          As developers at NebulaForge Studios, our passion for game
          creation was born in the arcades of 1994 — the flashing lights, roaring
          soundtracks, and fast-paced action that defined our childhoods. Star Grazer
          is our tribute to that golden era of gaming, reimagined for a new generation
          of players who love both nostalgia and innovation.
