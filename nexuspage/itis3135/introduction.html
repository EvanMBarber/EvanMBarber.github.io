<div class="about-me">
	<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Background: </strong> Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and lived here all my life</li>
    <li><strong>Academic Background: </strong> Got my “associate’s” degree in game design back in 2019. Decided to pivot over to computer science later on and now I am pursuing a B.S in computer science as of 2023. I am currently standing at a 4.0 as of this semester.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Background: </strong> I worked as a 3D graphics designer for a person for about 4 years, but contractual jobs diminished due to Covid. I then worked at Harris Teeter as a dairy clerk for about a year and a half, then I became a computer science TA for UNCC and I am currently a TA for ITSC2214 Data Structures and Algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Background in this subject: </strong> So far I know languages such as Python, Java, C, C#, RISC-V assembly, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong> custom built desktop, windows 10. Beeen running greatly since 2017</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Courses that I'm taking: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MATH 2122 - Intro to Probably & Statistics:</strong> I'm taking this because its required for my major, hopefully it will not be as hard as Calculus 2.</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC 3146 - Introduction to Operating Systems & Networks:</strong> Another course that is necessary for my major, I also find this course very critical for what I'm wanting to do.</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC3135 - Front-End Web App Development:</strong> Yet, another course required for my major although its very important to learn since companies only hire people who are full-stack nowadays.</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC3688 - Computers and their impact on society:</strong> For some reason this course is required for computer science majors, it doesn't seem too fun.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </strong> I came to this school with only 4th grade level math skills.</li>
